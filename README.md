Search Points
A Dart package that provides multiple search algorithms for finding elements in lists, including Linear, Binary, and Jump Search. Ideal for performance comparisons and algorithmic studies.

Features
Linear Search: Traverse the list sequentially to find the target element.
Binary Search: Efficiently search a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
Jump Search: Jump ahead by fixed steps to reduce the number of comparisons, suited for sorted lists.
Getting Started
To use the search_points package, follow these steps:

Add the package to your pubspec.yaml:

Usage
Here's how you can use the search_points package to perform different searches:

dart
Копировать код
import 'package:search_points/search_points.dart';

void main() {
  final searchPoints = SearchPoints();

  // Example data and target
  final List<dynamic> dataList = ['1', '36', '75', '35', '643', '5'];
  final String target = '35';

  // Perform searches
  final linearResults = searchPoints.linearSearch(dataList, target);
  final binaryResults = searchPoints.binarySearch(dataList, target);
  final jumpResults = searchPoints.jumpSearch(dataList, target);

  print('Linear Search Results: $linearResults');
  print('Binary Search Results: $binaryResults');
  print('Jump Search Results: $jumpResults');
}
